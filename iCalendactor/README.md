Roadmap:


Gonna need to update manually:

For now, push & diff via Google Apps Script?

* https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync (10k LOC)
* https://gist.github.com/afunTW/bf958eea15835d14aa976990d1f0bb88 (Python)
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50227276/obtaining-google-calendar-in-swift (Swift)
* https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bgoogle-apps-script (Starter SO search, not much for ics/ical)

* Add last update state variable
* Diff before and after events for detailed status updates

* Answer stack overflow question
* UI refactor

Longer term:

* Settings for calendar name, busy/Busy, timezone
* Listen for calendar changes/additions
* Save state between runs, e.g. selected calendar(s)
* Upload mechanism compaitble with sandbox settings

For consideration: 

* Auto-block the next N hours, e.g. no same-day Calendly scheduling
