Roadmap:

* https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync

* Add last update state variable
* Add local notifications ([example](https://medium.com/better-programming/scheduling-notifications-and-badges-in-swiftui-9edf8574b893))
* Run export automatically

* Answer stack overflow question
* Run export on wake, on start, every N hours
* UI refactor

Longer term:

*  Settings for calendar name, busy/Busy, timezone
* Diff before and after events for detailed status updates
* Listen for calendar changes/additions
* Save state between runs, e.g. selected calendar(s)
* Upload mechanism compaitble with sandbox settings

For consideration: 

* Auto-block the next N hours, e.g. no same-day Calendly scheduling
